# Training Installation Summary (Template)

This file is a template summary for a Windows GPU setup. Keep the real,
host-specific summary in your plugin repo (for example:
`~/Code/hafs_scawful/docs/INSTALLATION_SUMMARY.md`).

Use `~/Code/hafs_scawful/scripts/publish_plugin_configs.sh` to sync those
host-specific docs to halext-server and the Windows GPU host.
