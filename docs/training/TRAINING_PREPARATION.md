# Training Preparation (Template)

This document is a template for preparing a training run. Keep host-specific
hardware specs and IPs in your plugin repo (for example:
`~/Code/hafs_scawful/docs/training/TRAINING_PREPARATION.md`).

Use `~/Code/hafs_scawful/scripts/publish_plugin_configs.sh` to sync those
host-specific docs to halext-server and the Windows GPU host.

## Checklist

- Confirm GPU host availability
- Validate datasets and storage
- Confirm model routing
- Run health checks
