# Hybrid Training Infrastructure (Template)

This document describes a hybrid Mac + Windows GPU setup. Keep host-specific
paths, mount points, and IPs in your plugin repo (for example:
`~/Code/hafs_scawful/docs/training/HYBRID_TRAINING_INFRASTRUCTURE.md`).

Use `~/Code/hafs_scawful/scripts/publish_plugin_configs.sh` to sync those
host-specific docs to halext-server and the Windows GPU host.
