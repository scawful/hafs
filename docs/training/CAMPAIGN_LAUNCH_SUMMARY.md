# Campaign Launch Summary (Template)

This is a generic placeholder. Keep the detailed, host-specific campaign
summary in your plugin repo (for example:
`~/Code/hafs_scawful/docs/training/CAMPAIGN_LAUNCH_SUMMARY.md`).

Use `~/Code/hafs_scawful/scripts/publish_plugin_configs.sh` to sync those
host-specific docs to halext-server and the Windows GPU host.

## Suggested Contents
